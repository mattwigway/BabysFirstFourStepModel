Baby's First Four-Step Model is an R package and associated scripts that support a minimal [four-step travel demand model](https://transportgeography.org/contents/methods/spatial-interactions-gravity-model/transportation-land-use-four-stages-model/) intended for use in teaching. Simplicity is the primary goal; it is probably not advisable to use this for production travel forecasting, though I have tried to make the model as accurate as possible without compromising simplicity. Some of the simplifying assumptions that limit applicability are explained in the [limitations](#limitations) section.

The overarching goal is to produce a four-step model based primarily on nationwide open datasources (the [National Household Travel Survey](https://nhts.ornl.gov), the American Community Survey, the [LODES dataset](https://lehd.ces.census.gov), and [OpenStreetMap data](https://openstreetmap.org)). It is possible to estimate a model for a new region of the country in just a few lines of code (see [Estimation](#estimation)). The resulting model should be runnable in a single Jupyter notebook, hosted on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to facilitate teaching. No R knowledge is necessary to run the model.

## Estimation

### Trip generation

Trip generation is estimated using 20 trip generation regressions - home based work (from home), home based work (to home), home based other (from home), home based other (to home), and non-home-based, stratified by time of day (AM peak, PM peak, midday, overnight).

To estimate based on aggregate data, we create a seed matrix based on PUMS data for the entire region, and use that match ACS marginals in each tract.

### Destination choice/trip distribution

The destination choice/trip distribution model is the most difficult to calibrate using national datasets of all of the models, because the NHTS does not provide detailed spatial information about trip origins and destinations. To avoid this problem, we first estimate a spatial interaction model using the open [Puget Sound Household Travel Survey](https://psrc-psregcncl.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/household-travel-survey-trips/explore) dataset, which includes trip origins and destinations at the tract level in the public dataset. We use this to calibrate a gravity model based on Census and LODES data.

This model is only valid for the Puget Sound region. To adjust it for other regions, we retain the scale parameters for the origin and destination locations, but recalibrate the impedance parameter using the median-based method described in @merlin_new_2020.

## Limitations

In creating the simplest possible four-step model there are a number of significant limitations. In particular, there are no "extra" models beyond the four stepsâ€”no external trips model, no freight model, no college model, etc. This means that all of the traffic modeled will be personal vehicles.

It does not currently link transit trips with transfers in the middle, though many of these should already be reported as a single trip in the NHTS.
